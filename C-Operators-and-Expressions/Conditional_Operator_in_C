Conditional operator is Ternary Operator that is it takes 3 operands. The general syntax of this operator is as:

    expression1 ? expression2 : expression3;

Besides Operator Precedence and Associativity, It, like the logical operators, does exert some control on the order of evaluation of the entire expression. For example:

    (number >= 1000) ? a + b + c : d + e + f;

Here in the above example, if (number >= 1000) is TRUE then result of whole expression is expression2 which is (a + b + c) and expression3 (d + e + f) is not evaluated at all. But if (number >= 1000) evaluates to FALSE then result of the entire expression is expression3 which is (d + e + f) and expression2 isnâ€™t evaluated at all.

Basically, conditional operator is same as if-else construct. We can rewrite the above conditional expression as:

    if (expression1)
        expression2;
    else
        expression3;

Advantages of conditional operator over if-else construct:

Then what is the difference between conditional expression and if-else statement. Firstly, conditional expression is little bit more compact than if-else construct. For example:

    /* b written twice using if-else */
    if (ch == 'A')
        b = 5; 
    else		    
        b = ch + 5;
 
    /* b written once using conditional operator */
    b = (ch == 'A') ? 5 : ch + 5;

Consider another example:

    /* subscript written twice using if-else */
    if (a > 10)
        b[a + c / 5 * 10 - 2] = 100;
    else 		
        b[a + c / 5 * 10 - 2] = 1000;
 
    /* subscript written once using conditional operator */
    b[a + c / 5 * 10 - 2] = a > 10 ? 100 : 1000;

Notice in the above example, subscript is a complex exp. and there are chances of errors while typing it twice as in if-else. So, using the conditional statement, we can avoid such errors.
