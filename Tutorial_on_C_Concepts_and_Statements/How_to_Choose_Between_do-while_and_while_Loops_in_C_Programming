/*
 This C Tutorial explains the difference between do-while and while loops in C Programming.
*/

/*
 In do-while loop, condition is always tested after the the execution of the iteration and if condition fails, loop terminates. 
 Therefore, do-while loop executes at least one iteration before termination if condition fails in first iteration! 
 For example:
*/

#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    int counter = 0;
 
    do {
        /* loop executes just once printing the value 0 */
 
        printf("counter is %d\n", counter);
    } while(counter++ != 0);
 
    return 0;
}

/*
 In while loop, condition is checked before execution of each iteration and as condition fails, loop terminates. 
 For example:
*/

#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{		
    int counter = 0;
 
    /* loop terminates in the beginning of first iteration */
 
    while (counter++ != 0)
        printf("counter is %d\n", counter);
 
    /* here counter val is printed as 1 */
 
    printf("counter is %d\n", counter);
    return 0;      
}
