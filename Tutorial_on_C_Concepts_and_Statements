What are Escape Sequences (Character Escapes) in C Language

This C Tutorial explains Escape Sequences/Character Escapes and why they are needed.

One or more characters following ‘\’ (the backslash) is considered to be a single character and is called the escape sequence. For example:

\? used to write multiple question marks from being interpreted as trigraphs in printf() statements
\” used to get the quotation marks inside the string literals
\’ used to write a character literal for a character
\\ used to write a backslash from being interpreted as a character escape
\a \b etc.

Escape sequences are used in a program to override the special meaning of characters in particular contexts! For example:
*/

// Sample Code : 

#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
	printf ("What is your name? Are you \"CHIKU\"?");
	
	/*
		What is your name? Are you "CHIKU"?
		Note the name in output is enclosed in Quotation marks
	*/
}
