 Question: What is the output for the following code snippet? Will the program get compiled? If not, can you correct the condition in the if statement?

    if (;)
        printf("empty statement ; is considered true!");
    else
        printf("empty statement ; is considered false");

Answer: COMPILATION ERROR! Well! if the empty statement ” ; ” in the if statement is placed in the character literals ‘ ‘, program will compile and run successfully to display the first massage. Reason is characters are INTEGERS INTERNALLY. ; has decimal value 59 in ASCII Character Set. So, the working code would be:

    if (';')
        printf("empty statement ; is considered true!");
    else
        printf("empty statement ; is considered false");
