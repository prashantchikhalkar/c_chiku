/*
This C Tutorial explains “Dangling else” in C. 
It explains the association of single else statement in a nested if statement.
In nested if statements, when a single “else clause” occurs, 
the situation happens to be dangling else! For example:

if (condition)
        if (condition)
	    if (condition)
    else
        printf("dangling else!\n");  /* dangling else, as to which if statement, else clause associates */
        
1. In such situations, else clause belongs to the closest if statement 
	which is incomplete that is the innermost if statement!
2. However, we can make else clause belong to desired if statement by 
	enclosing all if statements in block outer to which if statement to associate the else clause. 
	
	For example:       
	
 if (condition) {
        if (condition)
            if (condition)
    } else
        printf("else associates with the outermost if statement!\n");
