Question: What is the difference between declaration and definition of a variable?

Answer: Declaration specifies the properties of a variable. For example:
  
  	int x;              // x is an integer
    	int roll_no[];      // roll_no is an array of integers
  
Definition declares a variable and causes the storage to be allocated. For example:
        int x = 10;         // x is declared as an integer and allocated space and initialized to 10
    	int roll_no[100];   // roll_no is declared as an array of integers, allocated space for 100 integers
